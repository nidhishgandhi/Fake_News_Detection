# Fake_News_Detection
->  Classifying and detecting news accuracy using PassiveAggressiveClassifier algorithm.
->  This is a Machine Learning Project. The aim of this project is to detect the accuracy of the news based on factors like title, text and label.
->  This project says whether the news is Real or Fake. 
->  This Project is created in Google colab and Machine Learning algorithm and classifiers are used to detect the accuracy of any given news. 
->  For this the dataset is taken of news and it is trained and then tested. 
->  The dataset is taken from Kaggle dataset.
